## Abstract
On Bi and Oliveria's paper "Typed First-Class Traits", they design a new
language named SEDEL.
This language supports first-class traits, dynamic inheritance, dynamic
dispatching and even abstract methods.
However, there are still a few OO features that SEDEL cannot model, like
binary methods.
For addressing this issue, we introduce iso-recursive types in order to
encode binary methods.
The new language, SEDEL plus iso-recursive types, is called iso-disjoint
intersection types!
Compared with last seminar, the authors create new subtyping rules for
iso-recursive types!
