## Abstract

In this talk I will show how to combine disjoint polymorphism with BCD
subtyping, culminating in a very expressive calculus named Fi+. The combination
is non-trivial and highly challenging in terms of coherence proof. I will then
show how to adapt the proof technique in the polymorphic setting. Finally I will
present a simple application of generic object algebra combinators.
