## About the speaker
Carol is a second year DPhil student at Oxford under the supervision of Prof Luke Ong. 
She is currently working on the semantics of probabilistic PL and deep probabilistic PL.

## Abstract
The scientific approach to obtain knowledge is to first
observe a phenomenon in the world, make hypothesis and then to run enough
experiments to convince ourselves that some conclusion can be drawn from the
experimental data. Machine learning intends to mimic this scientific approach in a
computer. One popular approach is Bayesian inference, where an estimated
distribution of a random variable (prior distribution) is transformed, according to
the likelihood of an observed data, to an updated distribution (posterior
distribution). Intuitively, this updated distribution is the “knowledge” the
computer gained by observing this particular data.
Probabilistic programming language is a language that facilitates
programmers to specify probabilistic models in a language such that their
executions correspond to Bayesian inference. Many practical probabilistic PLs are
equipped with posterior inference algorithms, and these languages are favoured by
data scientists since it frees them from the design of inference algorithms and
enable them to focus their time on the design of probabilistic models.
