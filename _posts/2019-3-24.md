## Abstract
On Bi and Oliveria's paper "Typed First-Class Traits", they design a
new language named SEDEL.
This language supports first-class traits, dynamic inheritance,
dynamic dispatching and even abstract methods.
However, there are still a few OO features that SEDEL cannot model,
like binary methods.
For addressing this issue, we introduce iso-recursive types in order
to encode binary methods.
The new language, SEDEL plus iso-recursive types, is called
iso-disjoint intersection types!
