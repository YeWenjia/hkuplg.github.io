## Abstract
Coppo, Dezani-Ciancaglini, and Salle invented the subtyping relationship
(Barendregt et al. (1983)), which bases on Intersection type, function
type, and other atom types. It is declarative and can not be implemented
directly. Bi et al. (2018) designed one algorithmic subtyping, extending
the BCD subtyping. Siek (2019) defined a new subtyping relation and it is
equivalent to the BCD subtyping. Bessai et al. (2019) focused on
performance so that invented a new fast algorithm. We compared those
algorithms and drew some conclusion.
